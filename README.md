# Untitled Digital Euro Board Game (Abandoned)

An abandoned Unity project, my first attempt at a "bigger" game, mainly used to learn how to implement turn-based mechanics in a real-time environment and as a test ground for various mechanics and engine features.

## Game Idea
The main objective was to create a solitaire digital/physical Euro-Style Board Game with abstract strategy elements, inspired by Splotter Spellen games like The Great Zimbabwe.

As development progressed, the project became directionless, with the core mechanic transformed countless times. It went from a Bag-Building mechanic to a Dice-Selection mechanic, as I experimented to find what would work best. The final state was a pure abstract, relying on a future tech-tree and supply-demand mechanics, which resulted in an unbalanced and broken game.

As the mechanics became scattered, the codebase also became convoluted, coupled, and hard to maintain and expand. Instead of refactoring, I decided that I had learned enough from the project and should focus on games with solidly defined Core Mechanics and direction. These would allow me to finish development, make the game fun and balanced in a reasonable time.

This project was a very knowledgeable experience. Combined with extra materials, I learned how to do many things the "proper" way for future projects, including better design patterns for different situations, optimization techniques, and writing cleaner and more robust code.
